The program should play a game of Hangman with the user. The program should:
1. First choose a secret word at random out of a list of words.
2. The program should then display a dash for each letter of the secret word.
3. The program should display the maximum number of incorrect guesses allowed.
4. The user should guess letters, one at a time, to try to guess the secret word.
5. If the user guesses a letter in the secret word that letter should replace the dash in the correct
position.
6. If the user guesses a letter that does not appear in the secret word the program should reduce
the number of incorrect guesses available by one.
7. If the user correctly guesses all the letters in the word, the user wins the game.
8. Otherwise when the user runs out of incorrect guesses the program wins.
9. After each game the user should have the option to play again.
